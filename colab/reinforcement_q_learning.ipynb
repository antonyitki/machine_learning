In this\n","task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment\n","terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more then 2.4\n","units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run\n","for longer duration, accumulating larger return.\n","\n","The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real\n","values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.).\n","However, neural networks can solve the task purely by looking at the\n","scene, so we'll use a patch of the screen centered on the cart as an\n","input. Because of this, our results aren't directly comparable to the\n","ones from the official leaderboard - our task is much harder.\n","Unfortunately this does slow down the training, because we have to\n","render all the frames.\n","\n","Strictly speaking, we will present the state as the difference between\n","the current screen patch and the previous one. This will allow the agent\n","to take the velocity of the pole into account from one image.\n","\n","**Packages**\n","\n","\n","First, let's import needed packages.
